summary: |-
  **Tools:** R, SQL, ABM, ABC
  
  **Problem:** When breaking into a new market it's hard to judge risks - especially when data is scarce.
  
  **Answer:** An agent-based simulation of market behavior, calibrated on a tiny test/train dataset with Approximate Bayesian Computation.
  
  **Outcome:** Used to win a share of a Â£500k UK government grant. Predicted weak market growth that drove out a major competitor in 2022.

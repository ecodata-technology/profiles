  preview_only: true
summary: |-
  **Tools:** R, SQL, Python, PCA, Hypothesis tests
  
  **Problem:** Field data are messy - unlike a lab, companies rarely have a perfect experiment planned out before they start collecting. Our client's data lacked controls and consistent treatments.
  
  **Answer:** Restructured the data to focus on correlations instead. Enriched the data by scraping climate and geospatial covariates from DAYMET and Google Earth Engine.
  
  **Outcome:** Rescued the dataset and sunk costs, developed meaningful guidelines for pest control.

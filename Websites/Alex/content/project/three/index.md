summary: When breaking into a new market, it's hard to judge business risks - especially when market data is mostly private. A built an agent-based simulation of market behavior and efficiently calibrated it on a tiny test/train dataset with Approximate Bayesian Computation. Used by Newton Launch Systems to win a share of a Â£500k UK government grant and to design a defensive business plan. Accurately predicted weak market growth that drove a major competitor out of the market in 2022.

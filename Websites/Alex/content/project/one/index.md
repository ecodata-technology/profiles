summary: Field data are messy - unlike a lab, companies rarely have a perfect experiment planned out before they start collecting. I rescued a dataset that written off by our client to provide meaningful guidelines for pest control. I enriched the data by scraping climate and geospatial covariates from DAYMET and Google Earth Engine, using PCA to to squeeze in all these correlations.

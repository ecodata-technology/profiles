summary: Marine zooplankton feed the rest of the ocean and sustain fishing industries, but are threatened by climate change and its indirect effects such as decline in the algae they graze on. I built models with my own data and showed with sensitivity analyses how less algae means zooplankton populations become sensitive to fertility crashes, which in turn could starve the fish that feed on them.
